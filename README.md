## Electra 11.2 - 11.3.1 support
Delectra can be used to fix/re-jailbreak your device as reported [here](https://github.com/KirovAir/delectra/issues/12).
I'm not sure all leftover files are removed as of yet so I can not guarantee a clean state. I'll look into the current Electra release ASAP.

# delectra
An uninstaller script for Coolstars' [Electra](https://github.com/coolstar/electra) iOS 11.0 - 11.1.2 jailbreak.
Please read everything in this readme before you do anything!

## Why?
SemiRestore11 is not released yet and I wanted to revert the JB. (b10 was a lot more stable for me)

I followed all filesystem changes from the jailbreak bootstrap files and electra source code and added those to the unjailbreak.sh script. This should undo everything done by the installer, __except the APFS snapshot.__ (So SemiRestore11 should still work when it comes out.)

!! DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING !!
This is not recommended by Coolstar or even myself.

## How to use?
1. Uninstall ALL __user__ installed packages and tweaks. You can use SemiRestore11-lite for this now!
2. Put unjailbreak.sh on your phone. I'd recommend putting it in /electra so it will be removed by itself
3. Reboot your device and rejailbreak _without_ tweaks enabled. (This should make the process more stable)
4. SSH into your phone as __root__ and run unjailbreak.sh from this repo:
```
cd /electra
sh unjailbreak.sh
```
5. Wait until the device reboots and then reboot again.

## User reports
Wait for SemiRestore to avoid any risk at all since I can _NOT_ guarantee a successful uninstall. Every system is different after multiple tweak installations so make sure you remove every tweak you have installed to be as stock as possible.

__Update 01-03-2018:__ Multiple people on Reddit and [here](https://github.com/KirovAir/delectra/issues/2) have used the script succesfully on various devices.

__Update 04-03-2018:__ Even futurerestore(d) devices seems to work, as well as the iPhone 6s as seen in the [user reports](https://github.com/KirovAir/delectra/issues/2). Still, be careful!

## Troubleshooting
#### My tweaks are not working on the betas anymore?
This was an issue when you used an older version of this script. This is fixed now.
1. SSH into your phone as __root__ and run:
```
mkdir /Library/Frameworks/
```
2. Reboot and re-jailbreak with a beta electra version and it should be fixed.

#### I get a topanga error when I try to rejailbreak
This happens when there are still some remaining files on your system from unfortunate packages or tweaks. The latest version of this script should take care of this for you. 
This may also happen when the script gets aborted half-way through. 

- If you still have SSH access simply re-run the latest version of this script.
- If not use Filza and (carefully!) check for any of the files in [this list](https://gist.github.com/KirovAir/a84afe1c8e75309abd731893ed5e1e37) and remove them. __Do not remove directories.__ Remove the files one by one there are crucial system files in some of the directories next to the topanga files.
